# What is this?

* Estimates Zabbix DB size using Zabbix API. Tested on 2.2.3.
* Relies on jqzabbix.

## Note

* At this point this works only with localhost.
* Zabbix Server 2.2.3 does not support COURS or JSONP,
and thus there seems no way to let JS obtain cross-domain data.
* Let me know if I'm wrong. I'll be happy to fix my code :-)
